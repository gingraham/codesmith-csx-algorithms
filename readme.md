Codesmith CSX Algorithms Practice
Overview
This repository contains my solutions to the Codesmith CSX algorithms. It is organized into folders based on core JavaScript concepts. Each folder contains algorithm exercises related to that specific concept, with each exercise written as a separate JavaScript file.

✅ [ ] Algorithm 3
Folder: /functions-and-execution-context
2. Callbacks & Higher-order Functions
✅ [ ] Algorithm 1
✅ [ ] Algorithm 2
✅ [ ] Algorithm 3
Folder: /callbacks-and-higher-order-functions
3. Closure, Scope & Execution Context
✅ [ ] Algorithm 1
✅ [ ] Algorithm 2
✅ [ ] Algorithm 3
Folder: /closure-scope-and-execution-context
4. Recursion
✅ [ ] Algorithm 1
✅ [ ] Algorithm 2
✅ [ ] Algorithm 3
Folder: /recursion
5. Object Oriented Programming
✅ [ ] Algorithm 1
✅ [ ] Algorithm 2
✅ [ ] Algorithm 3
Folder: /object-oriented-programming
6. Asynchronous JavaScript
✅ [ ] Algorithm 1
✅ [ ] Algorithm 2
